# Agent Skills Library

A portable GitHub library for reusable Agent Skills.

This repo is designed for a workflow where ChatGPT helps brainstorm and author skills, while Codex creates folders, writes files, updates catalogs, and keeps the repository organized.

## What this repo is

This repository is a **source library** of skills.

Skills here are meant to be:

- browsed on GitHub
- copied into another project
- downloaded as reusable packages
- adapted for local agent environments
- maintained with taxonomy and catalog metadata

## What this repo is not

This repository is not primarily a live Codex runtime skill folder.

The source path is:

```txt
skills/<category>/<skill-name>/SKILL.md
```

Do not treat `.agents/skills/` as the source location for this library. That path may be used later only as an optional installation/export destination.

## Repository structure

```

## Skill package shape

Each skill is a folder with a required `SKILL.md` file.

Optional support folders may be added when useful:

```txt
references/
scripts/
assets/
agents/
```

Example:

```txt
skills/code-review/bundle-bloat-review/
├─ SKILL.md
├─ references/
│  └─ bundling-checklist.md
└─ scripts/
   └─ inspect-package.mjs
```

## Creating a new skill

1. Draft the skill idea with ChatGPT.
2. Confirm the name, category, trigger description, and target path.
3. Ask Codex to create the skill package under:

   ```txt
   skills/<category>/<skill-name>/SKILL.md
   ```

4. Codex updates:

   ```txt
   catalog/skills.json
   README.md
   docs/TAXONOMY.md, if needed
   ```

5. Review the result with `docs/REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md`.

## Installing or copying a skill elsewhere

Copy the skill folder from:

```txt
skills/<category>/<skill-name>/
```

into the target agent environment expected by the consumer.

For example, a user may copy:

```txt
skills/repo-readiness/github-pages-readiness/
```

into a local skills directory supported by their agent tooling.

See `docs/EXPORT_INSTALL_GUIDE.md` for details.

## Authoring standards

A good skill:

- has one clear job
- has a specific trigger description
- names the files or inputs it inspects
- uses a step-by-step workflow
- declares side effects
- returns predictable output
- can be reused outside this repository
